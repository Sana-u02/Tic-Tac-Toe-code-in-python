# Tic-Tac-Toe-code-in-python
 A Tic Tac Toe game in Python has a 3x3 board and two players, X and O, taking turns. Players specify moves by row and column. The game checks for wins by evaluating rows, columns, and diagonals, and checks for a draw if all cells are filled. The loop continues until a player wins or it's a draw, updating the board each turn.

The key elements of a Tic Tac Toe game include:

Game Board: A 3x3 grid where players place their marks (X or O).

Players: Two players, usually represented by X and O.

Game Logic: Rules to check for valid moves, win conditions, and draw conditions.

Gameplay Loop: A loop that alternates between players until the game ends.
